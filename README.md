# Basic Website Templates

## Directory Structure

There are three folders in this repository 

    elements/
    website_horizontal_layout/
    website_vertical_layout/

The elements/ directory contains several different design elements that can be used in a basic HTML website. Navigation menus, toggling between images, adding quotes and tables, adding different types of forms with different layouts, adding sidebars that toggle in and out of the screen. 

The website_horizontal_layout/ and website_vertical_layout/ both provide examples of how to create websites with columns and rows. 

A lot of this code was learnt from tutorials on https://www.w3schools.com.
